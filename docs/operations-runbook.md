# TF20 Portal Operations Runbook

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Fill in:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL`
   - `STEAM_WEB_API_KEY`
4. Run:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run prisma:generate`
   - `npm run prisma:migrate`
   - `npm run db:seed`
   - `npm run dev`

## Production Deployment

Live app:

- host: `216.225.152.12`
- app dir: `/opt/tf20/app`
- service: `tf20`

### Safe deploy procedure

1. Pull latest code locally.
2. Run `npm run check`.
3. Run `npm run smoke`.
4. Back up the live files on the VPS before replacing them.
5. Back up the live database when personnel/application/LOA/event code changed:
   - `cd /opt/tf20/app`
   - `set -a && . ./.env && set +a && npm run backup:db -- --dir=/opt/tf20/backups`
6. Copy only the changed files or deploy the full updated checkout.
7. On the VPS, ensure file ownership remains `tf20:tf20` for app files.
8. Restart the service:
   - `systemctl restart tf20`
9. Verify:
   - `systemctl is-active tf20`
   - `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health`
   - `npm run access:audit`
   - `npm run readiness:audit -- --output=.private/production-readiness-audit.json`
   - browser login flow on `https://taskforce20.com`
   - member profile view loads
   - recruiter/staff application queue loads
   - staff personnel roster loads
   - LOA queue loads
   - support queue loads
   - events page loads and attendance review opens for a selected event
   - audit log loads for a privileged account

## Production Environment

Server-only secrets stay in:

- `/opt/tf20/app/.env`

Never copy this file into the repo or into private exports.

## Cutover Rules

- Website database is the source of truth after roster import verification.
- Airtable is migration-only and should not receive operational updates after
  cutover.
- Discord identity issues should be corrected through controlled relinking, not
  by directly editing random database rows without an audit trail.

## Recovery Checks

When a deployment fails:

1. Check service status and logs:
   - `systemctl status tf20`
   - `journalctl -u tf20 --since "15 minutes ago" --no-pager`
2. Confirm `.env` is still present and readable by the service.
3. Confirm `DATABASE_URL`, Discord credentials, and Prisma client are intact.
4. Restore the file backup or previous checkout if the service cannot recover.

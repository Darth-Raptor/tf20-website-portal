# Phase 2 Backend Review Workbook

## Purpose

This workbook is the temporary **Phase 2 review authority** for backend
finalization. It is designed to be read and edited like a review packet first,
and a backend reference second.

If this workbook conflicts with current schema, catalog, route, or doc
wording, this workbook wins for Phase 2 implementation.

## How To Use This Workbook

Recommended editing order:

1. complete the terminology and naming review
2. complete the schema and enum review
3. complete the catalog review
4. complete the access and workflow contract review
5. fill out the signoff section at the end
6. use the appendices only when you need exact current values

Editing rules:

- mark unresolved items with `[UNRESOLVED]`
- mark intentionally deferred items with `[DEFER]`
- if you want something renamed, removed, merged, split, or added, say so
  directly in the relevant decision form
- keep final decisions short and explicit so implementation does not need to
  infer intent

Current local baseline before Phase 2:

- planning Areas 1 through 6 are complete
- catalog governance is implemented
- runtime auth/session/gating is implemented
- applicant-to-member flow is implemented
- personnel core roster slice is implemented

Currently implemented runtime route families:

- `/auth/*`
- `/me/*`
- `/applications/*`
- `/personnel/*`
